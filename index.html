    <h1 id="about-me">Hello, Welcome</h1> 
     <p>I'm Juliette Navarro</p>
    <p2>In Long Beach, California, on August 18, 2006, I was born. Together with my parents, my siblings and I created a family of nine people, consisting of my four brothers and two sisters. I have relocated six times in the last eighteen years of my life. I relocated from Long Beach to Shafter around seven years ago, and that was my last move. I have attended four different schools over the past seven and a half years: Sequoia Elementary, Redwood Elementary, RJH, and Shafter High School. I have already graduated from RJH and I am now in my 4th year of High School.</p2>
